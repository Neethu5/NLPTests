       "'London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom.\\nStanding on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain,\\nLondon has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the\\nRomans, who named it Londinium. London\\'s ancient core, the City of London,\\nlargely retains its 1.12-square-mile (2.9 km2) medieval boundaries. Since at\\nleast the 19th century, \"London\" has also referred to the metropolis around\\nthis core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent and\\nHertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, a region governed\\nby the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.London is a leading global city\\nin the arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare,\\nmedia, professional services, research and development, tourism and\\ntransportation. It is the world\\'s largest financial centre and has the fifth or\\nsixth largest metropolitan area GDP in the world. London is often regarded as a\\nworld cultural capital. It is the world\\'s most-visited city as measured by\\ninternational arrivals and has the world\\'s largest city airport system measured\\nby passenger traffic. It is the world\\'s leading investment destination, hosting\\nmore international retailers and ultra high-net-worth individuals than any\\nother city. London\\'s universities form the largest concentration of higher\\neducation institutes in Europe. In 2012, London became the first city to have\\nhosted the modern Summer Olympic Games three times.London has a diverse range\\nof people and cultures, and more than 300 languages are spoken in the region.\\nIts estimated mid-2016 municipal population (corresponding to Greater London)\\nwas 8,787,892, the largest of any city in the European Union and accounting for\\n13.4% of the UK population. London\\'s urban area is the second most populous in\\nthe EU, after Paris, with 9,787,426 inhabitants at the 2011 census. The city\\'s\\nmetropolitan area is the most populous in the EU with 14,040,163 inhabitants in\\n2016, while the Greater London Authority states the population of the\\ncity-region (covering a large part of the south east) as 22.7 million. London\\nwas the world\\'s most populous city from around 1831 to 1925. London contains\\nfour World Heritage Sites: the Tower of London; Kew Gardens; the site\\ncomprising the Palace of Westminster, Westminster Abbey, and St Margaret\\'s\\nChurch; and the historic settlement of Greenwich (in which the Royal\\nObservatory, Greenwich defines the Prime Meridian, 0Â° longitude, and GMT).\\nOther landmarks include Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, Piccadilly Circus,\\nSt Paul\\'s Cathedral, Tower Bridge, Trafalgar Square and The Shard. London is\\nhome to numerous museums, galleries, libraries, sporting events and other\\ncultural institutions, including the British Museum, National Gallery, Natural\\nHistory Museum, Tate Modern, British Library and West End theatres. The London\\nUnderground is the oldest underground railway network in the world.\\n\\nThe etymology of London is uncertain. It is an ancient name, attested already in\\nthe first century AD, usually in the Latinised form Londinium; for example,\\nhandwritten Roman tablets recovered in the city originating from AD 65/70-80\\ninclude the word Londinio (\"in London\").Over the years, the name has attracted\\nmany mythicising explanations. The earliest attested appears in Geoffrey of\\nMonmouth\\'s Historia Regum Britanniae, written around 1136. This had it that the\\nname originated from a supposed King Lud, who had allegedly taken over the city\\nand named it Kaerlud.Modern scientific analyses of the name must account for\\nthe origins of the different forms found in early sources Latin (usually\\nLondinium), Old English (usually Lunden), and Welsh (usually Llundein), with\\nreference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different\\nlanguages. It is agreed that the name came into these languages from Common\\nBrythonic; recent work tends to reconstruct the lost Celtic form of the name as\\n*[Londonjon] or something similar. This was adapted into Latin as Londinium and\\nborrowed into West Germanic, the ancestor-language of English, before English\\nhad become widely spoken in what later became England.The etymology and\\noriginal meaning of the Common Brythonic form is much debated. A prominent\\nexplanation was Richard Coates\\'s 1998 argument that the name derived from\\npre-Celtic Old European *(p)lowonida, meaning \"river too wide to ford\". Coates\\nsuggested that this was a name given to the part of the River Thames which\\nflows through London; from this, the settlement gained the Celtic form of its\\nname, *Lowonidonjon. However, most work has accepted a Celtic origin for the\\nname, and recent studies have favoured an explanation along the lines of a\\nCeltic derivative of an proto-Indo-European root *lendh- (\\'sink, cause to\\nsink\\'), combined with the Celtic suffix *-injo- or *-onjo- (used to form\\nplace-names). Peter Schrijver has specifically suggested, on these grounds,\\nthat the name originally meant \\'place that floods (periodically,\\ntidally)\\'.Until 1889, the name \"London\" officially applied only to the City of\\nLondon, but since then it has also referred to the County of London and now to\\nGreater London.\"London\" is sometimes abbreviated as \"L\\'don\" or \"LDN\".\\n\\nTwo recent discoveries indicate probable very early settlements near the Thames in\\nthe London area. In 1999, the remains of a Bronze Age bridge were found on the\\nsouth foreshore, upstream of Vauxhall Bridge. This bridge either crossed the\\nThames or reached a now lost island in it. Dendrochronology dated the timbers\\nto ca. 1500 BC. In 2010 the foundations of a large timber structure, dated to\\nca. 4500 BC, were found on the Thames foreshore, south of Vauxhall Bridge. The\\nfunction of the mesolithic structure is not known. Both structures are on the\\nsouth bank, at a natural crossing point where the River Effra flows into the\\nThames.\\n\\nAlthough there is evidence of scattered Brythonic settlements in\\nthe area, the first major settlement was founded by the Romans about four years\\nafter the invasion of AD 43. This lasted only until around AD 61, when the\\nIceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it, burning it to the ground. The\\nnext, heavily planned, incarnation of Londinium prospered, and it superseded\\nColchester as the capital of the Roman province of Britannia in 100. At its\\nheight in the 2nd century, Roman London had a population of around 60,000.\\nWith the collapse of Roman rule in the early 5th century, London ceased to be a\\ncapital, and the walled city of Londinium was effectively abandoned, although\\nRoman civilisation continued in the area of St Martin-in-the-Fields until\\naround 450. From around 500, an Anglo-Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic\\ndeveloped slightly west of the old Roman city. By about 680, the city had\\nregrown into a major port, although there is little evidence of large-scale\\nproduction. From the 820s repeated Viking assaults brought decline. Three are\\nrecorded; those in 851 and 886 succeeded, while the last, in 994, was\\nrebuffed.\\n\\nThe Vikings established Danelaw over much of eastern and northern\\nEngland; its boundary stretched roughly from London to Chester. It was an area\\nof political and geographical control imposed by the Viking incursions which\\nwas formally agreed by the Danish warlord, Guthrum and the West Saxon king\\nAlfred the Great in 886. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recorded that Alfred\\n\"refounded\" London in 886. Archaeological research shows that this involved\\nabandonment of Lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old Roman\\nwalls. London then grew slowly until about 950, after which activity increased\\ndramatically.By the 11th century, London was beyond all comparison the largest\\ntown in England. Westminster Abbey, rebuilt in the Romanesque style by King\\nEdward the Confessor, was one of the grandest churches in Europe. Winchester\\nhad previously been the capital of Anglo-Saxon England, but from this time on,\\nLondon became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in\\ntime of war. In the view of Frank Stenton: \"It had the resources, and it was\\nrapidly developing the dignity and the political self-consciousness appropriate\\nto a national capital.\"\\n\\nAfter winning the Battle of Hastings, William, Duke\\nof Normandy was crowned King of England in the newly completed Westminster\\nAbbey on Christmas Day 1066. William constructed the Tower of London, the first\\nof the many Norman castles in England to be rebuilt in stone, in the\\nsoutheastern corner of the city, to intimidate the native inhabitants. In 1097,\\nWilliam II began the building of Westminster Hall, close by the abbey of the\\nsame name. The hall became the basis of a new Palace of Westminster.In the 12th\\ncentury, the institutions of central government, which had hitherto accompanied\\nthe royal English court as it moved around the country, grew in size and\\nsophistication and became increasingly fixed in one place. For most purposes\\nthis was Westminster, although the royal treasury, having been moved from\\nWinchester, came to rest in the Tower. While the City of Westminster developed\\ninto a true capital in governmental terms, its distinct neighbour, the City of\\nLondon, remained England\\'s largest city and principal commercial centre, and it\\nflourished under its own unique administration, the Corporation of London. In\\n1100, its population was around 18,000; by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000.\\nDisaster struck in the form of the Black Death in the mid-14th century, when\\nLondon lost nearly a third of its population. London was the focus of the\\nPeasants\\' Revolt in 1381.London was also a centre of England\\'s Jewish\\npopulation before their expulsion by Edward I in 1290. Violence against Jews\\ntook place in 1190, after it was rumoured that the new King had ordered their\\nmassacre after they had presented themselves at his coronation. In 1264 during\\nthe Second Barons\\' War, Simon de Montfort\\'s rebels killed 500 Jews while\\nattempting to seize records of debts.\\n\\nDuring the Tudor period the Reformation produced a gradual shift to Protestantism, and much of London\\nproperty passed from church to private ownership, which accelerated trade and\\nbusiness in the city. In 1475, the Hanseatic League set up its main trading\\nbase (kontor) of England in London, called the Stalhof or Steelyard. It existed\\nuntil 1853, when the Hanseatic cities of LÃ¼beck, Bremen and Hamburg sold the\\nproperty to South Eastern Railway. Woollen cloth was shipped undyed and\\nundressed from 14th/15th century London to the nearby shores of the Low\\nCountries, where it was considered indispensable.But the reach of English\\nmaritime enterprise hardly extended beyond the seas of north-west Europe. The\\ncommercial route to Italy and the Mediterranean Sea normally lay through\\nAntwerp and over the Alps; any ships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar to\\nor from England were likely to be Italian or Ragusan. Upon the re-opening of\\nthe Netherlands to English shipping in January 1565, there ensued a strong\\noutburst of commercial activity. The Royal Exchange was founded. Mercantilism\\ngrew, and monopoly trading companies such as the East India Company were\\nestablished, with trade expanding to the New World. London became the principal\\nNorth Sea port, with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population\\nrose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.In the 16th\\ncentury William Shakespeare and his contemporaries lived in London at a time of\\nhostility to the development of the theatre. By the end of the Tudor period in\\n1603, London was still very compact. There was an assassination attempt on\\nJames I in Westminster, in the Gunpowder Plot on 5 November 1605.\\n\\nIn the English Civil War the majority of Londoners supported the Parliamentary cause.\\nAfter an initial advance by the Royalists in 1642, culminating in the battles\\nof Brentford and Turnham Green, London was surrounded by a defensive perimeter\\nwall known as the Lines of Communication. The lines were built by up to 20,000\\npeople, and were completed in under two months. The fortifications failed their\\nonly test when the New Model Army entered London in 1647, and they were\\nlevelled by Parliament the same year.London was plagued by disease in the early\\n17th century, culminating in the Great Plague of 1665â€“1666, which killed up to\\n100,000 people, or a fifth of the population.\\n\\nThe Great Fire of London broke out in 1666 in Pudding Lane in the city and quickly swept through the wooden\\nbuildings. Rebuilding took over ten years and was supervised by Robert Hooke as\\nSurveyor of London. In 1708 Christopher Wren\\'s masterpiece, St Paul\\'s Cathedral\\nwas completed. During the Georgian era, new districts such as Mayfair were\\nformed in the west; new bridges over the Thames encouraged development in South\\nLondon. In the east, the Port of London expanded downstream. London\\'s\\ndevelopment as an international financial centre matured for much of the 1700s.\\nIn 1762, George III acquired Buckingham House and it was enlarged over the next\\n75 years. During the 18th century, London was dogged by crime, and the Bow\\nStreet Runners were established in 1750 as a professional police force. In\\ntotal, more than 200 offences were punishable by death, including petty theft.\\nMost children born in the city died before reaching their third birthday.\\nThe coffeehouse became a popular place to debate ideas, with growing literacy\\nand the development of the printing press making news widely available; and\\nFleet Street became the centre of the British press. Following the invasion of\\nAmsterdam by Napoleonic armies, many financiers relocated to London, especially\\na large Jewish community, and the first London international\\nissue[clarification needed] was arranged in 1817. Around the same time, the\\nRoyal Navy became the world leading war fleet[citation needed], acting as a\\nserious deterrent to potential economic adversaries of the United Kingdom. The\\nrepeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 was specifically aimed at weakening Dutch\\neconomic power[citation needed]. London then overtook Amsterdam as the leading\\ninternational financial centre[citation needed].\\n\\nIn 1888, London became home to a series of murders by a man known only as Jack the Ripper and It has since\\nbecome one of the world\\'s most famous unsolved mysteries. According to Samuel\\nJohnson:  You find no man, at all intellectual, who is willing to leave London.\\nNo, Sir, when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in\\nLondon all that life can afford.â€”â€‰Samuel Johnson, 1777\\n\\nLondon was the world\\'s largest city from about 1831 to 1925. London\\'s overcrowded conditions\\nled to cholera epidemics, claiming 14,000 lives in 1848, and 6,000 in 1866.\\nRising traffic congestion led to the creation of the world\\'s first local urban\\nrail network. The Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion\\nin the capital and some of the surrounding counties; it was abolished in 1889\\nwhen the London County Council was created out of those areas of the counties\\nsurrounding the capital. London was bombed by the Germans during the First\\nWorld War, and during the Second World War, the Blitz and other bombings by the\\nGerman Luftwaffe killed over 30,000 Londoners, destroying large tracts of\\nhousing and other buildings across the city. Immediately after the war, the\\n1948 Summer Olympics were held at the original Wembley Stadium, at a time when\\nLondon was still recovering from the war.\\n\\nFrom the 1940s onwards, London became home to a large number of immigrants, primarily from Commonwealth\\ncountries such as Jamaica, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, making London one of\\nthe most diverse cities worldwide. In 1951, the Festival of Britain was held on\\nthe South Bank. The Great Smog of 1952 led to the Clean Air Act 1956, which\\nended the \"pea soup fogs\" for which London had been notorious.Primarily\\nstarting in the mid-1960s, London became a centre for the worldwide youth\\nculture, exemplified by the Swinging London subculture associated with the\\nKing\\'s Road, Chelsea and Carnaby Street. The role of trendsetter was revived\\nduring the punk era. In 1965 London\\'s political boundaries were expanded to\\ntake into account the growth of the urban area and a new Greater London Council\\nwas created. During The Troubles in Northern Ireland, London was subjected to\\nbombing attacks by the Provisional IRA. Racial inequality was highlighted by\\nthe 1981 Brixton riot.Greater London\\'s population declined steadily in the\\ndecades after the Second World War, from an estimated peak of 8.6 million in\\n1939 to around 6.8 million in the 1980s. The principal ports for London moved\\ndownstream to Felixstowe and Tilbury,[citation needed] with the London\\nDocklands area becoming a focus for regeneration, including the Canary Wharf\\ndevelopment. This was borne out of London\\'s ever-increasing role as a major\\ninternational financial centre during the 1980s. The Thames Barrier was\\ncompleted in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the North\\nSea.From the 1970s, London became a common target of IRA terrorist attacks for\\ntwo decades, starting with the Old Bailey bombing in 1973.\\n\\nThe Greater London Council was abolished in 1986, which left London without a central\\nadministration until 2000 when London-wide government was restored, with the\\ncreation of the Greater London Authority. To celebrate the start of the 21st\\ncentury, the Millennium Dome, London Eye and Millennium Bridge were\\nconstructed. On 6 July 2005 London was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics, making\\nLondon the first city to stage the Olympic Games three times. On 7 July 2005,\\nthree London Underground trains and a double-decker bus were bombed in a series\\nof terrorist attacks.In 2008, London named alongside New York City and Hong\\nKong as Nylonkong, being hailed as the world\\'s three most influential global\\ncities. In January 2015, Greater London\\'s population was estimated to be 8.63\\nmillion, the highest level since 1939. During the Brexit referendum in 2016,\\nthe UK as a whole decided to leave the European Union, but a majority of London\\nconstituencies voted to remain in the EU.Suicides among youngsters between 10\\nand 19 years old rose by 107% from 2013 to 2016.  Experts feel this is due to\\nexcessive pressure in youngsters\\' environment and youngstersd in deprived areas\\nfeel they have no future in terms of jobs or education.  Mental health services\\nfor young people who need them are inadequate.  People should not generalize,\\npeople from a range of backgrounds can feel under pressure and suicidal for a\\nrange of reasons.\\n\\nThe administration of London is formed of two tiers: a citywide,\\nstrategic tier and a local tier. Citywide administration is\\ncoordinated by the Greater London Authority (GLA), while local administration\\nis carried out by 33 smaller authorities. The GLA consists of two elected\\ncomponents: the Mayor of London, who has executive powers, and the London\\nAssembly, which scrutinises the mayor\\'s decisions and can accept or reject the\\nmayor\\'s budget proposals each year. The headquarters of the GLA is City Hall,\\nSouthwark; the mayor is Sadiq Khan, the first Muslim mayor of a major Western\\ncapital. The mayor\\'s statutory planning strategy is published as the London\\nPlan, which was most recently revised in 2011. The local authorities are the\\ncouncils of the 32 London boroughs and the City of London Corporation. They are\\nresponsible for most local services, such as local planning, schools, social\\nservices, local roads and refuse collection. Certain functions, such as waste\\nmanagement, are provided through joint arrangements. In 2009â€“2010 the combined\\nrevenue expenditure by London councils and the GLA amounted to just over Â£22\\nbillion (Â£14.7 billion for the boroughs and Â£7.4 billion for the GLA).The\\nLondon Fire Brigade is the statutory fire and rescue service for Greater\\nLondon. It is run by the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority and is\\nthe third largest fire service in the world. National Health Service ambulance\\nservices are provided by the London Ambulance Service (LAS) NHS Trust, the\\nlargest free-at-the-point-of-use emergency ambulance service in the world. The\\nLondon Air Ambulance charity operates in conjunction with the LAS where\\nrequired. Her Majesty\\'s Coastguard and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution\\noperate on the River Thames, which is under the jurisdiction of the Port of\\nLondon Authority from Teddington Lock to the sea.\\n\\n London is the seat of the\\nGovernment of the United Kingdom. Many government departments, as well as the\\nPrime Minister\\'s residence at 10 Downing Street, are based close to the Palace\\nof Westminster, particularly along Whitehall. The British Parliament is often\\nreferred to as the \"Mother of Parliaments\" (although this sobriquet was first\\napplied to England itself, and not to Westminster, by John Bright) because it\\nhas been a model for many other parliamentary systems. There are 73 Members of\\nParliament (MPs) from London, elected from local parliamentary constituencies\\nin the national Parliament. As of May 2015, 49 are from the Labour Party, 21\\nare Conservatives, and three are Liberal Democrat.The UK government ministerial\\npost of Minister for London was created in 1994 and currently occupied by Jo\\nJohnson.\\n\\nPolicing in Greater London, with the exception of the City of\\nLondon, is provided by the Metropolitan Police Service, overseen by the Mayor\\nthrough the Mayor\\'s Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC). The City of London\\nhas its own police force â€“ the City of London Police. The British Transport\\nPolice are responsible for police services on National Rail, London\\nUnderground, Docklands Light Railway and Tramlink services. A fourth police\\nforce in London, the Ministry of Defence Police, do not generally become\\ninvolved with policing the general public. Crime rates vary widely by area,\\nranging from parts with serious issues to parts considered very safe. Today\\ncrime figures are made available nationally at Local Authority and Ward level.\\nIn 2015 there were 118 homicides, a 25.5% increase over 2014. The Metropolitan\\nPolice have made detailed crime figures, broken down by category at borough and\\nward level, available on their website since 2000.Recorded crime has been\\nrising in London, notably violent crime and murder by stabbing and other means\\nhave risen.  There have been 50 murders from the start of 2018 to mid April\\n2018.  Funding cuts to the London police likely contributed to this though\\nother factors are also involved.\\n\\n\\n\\nLondon, also referred to as Greater\\nLondon, is one of nine regions of England and the top-level subdivision\\ncovering most of the city\\'s metropolis. The small ancient City of London at its\\ncore once comprised the whole settlement, but as its urban area grew, the\\nCorporation of London resisted attempts to amalgamate the city with its\\nsuburbs, causing \"London\" to be defined in a number of ways for different\\npurposes.Forty per cent of Greater London is covered by the London post town,\\nwithin which \\'LONDON\\' forms part of postal addresses. The London telephone area\\ncode (020) covers a larger area, similar in size to Greater London, although\\nsome outer districts are excluded and some places just outside are included.\\nThe Greater London boundary has been aligned to the M25 motorway in\\nplaces.Outward urban expansion is now prevented by the Metropolitan Green Belt,\\nalthough the built-up area extends beyond the boundary in places, resulting in\\na separately defined Greater London Urban Area. Beyond this is the vast London\\ncommuter belt. Greater London is split for some purposes into Inner London and\\nOuter London. The city is split by the River Thames into North and South, with\\nan informal central London area in its interior. The coordinates of the nominal\\ncentre of London, traditionally considered to be the original Eleanor Cross at\\nCharing Cross near the junction of Trafalgar Square and Whitehall, are about\\n51Â°30â€²26â€³N 00Â°07â€²39â€³Wï»¿ / ï»¿51.50722Â°N 0.12750Â°Wï»¿ / 51.50722; -0.12750. However\\nthe geographical centre of London, on one definition, is in the London Borough\\nof Lambeth, just 0.1 miles to the northeast of Lambeth North tube station.\\nWithin London, both the City of London and the City of Westminster have city\\nstatus and both the City of London and the remainder of Greater London are\\ncounties for the purposes of lieutenancies. The area of Greater London has\\nincorporated areas that are part of the historic counties of Middlesex, Kent,\\nSurrey, Essex and Hertfordshire. London\\'s status as the capital of England, and\\nlater the United Kingdom, has never been granted or confirmed officiallyâ€”by\\nstatute or in written form.Its position was formed through constitutional\\nconvention, making its status as de facto capital a part of the UK\\'s unwritten\\nconstitution. The capital of England was moved to London from Winchester as the\\nPalace of Westminster developed in the 12th and 13th centuries to become the\\npermanent location of the royal court, and thus the political capital of the\\nnation. More recently, Greater London has been defined as a region of England\\nand in this context is known as London.\\n\\nGreater London encompasses a total\\narea of 1,583 square kilometres (611 sq mi), an area which had a population of\\n7,172,036 in 2001 and a population density of 4,542 inhabitants per square\\nkilometre (11,760/sq mi). The extended area known as the London Metropolitan\\nRegion or the London Metropolitan Agglomeration, comprises a total area of\\n8,382 square kilometres (3,236 sq mi) has a population of 13,709,000 and a\\npopulation density of 1,510 inhabitants per square kilometre (3,900/sq mi).\\nModern London stands on the Thames, its primary geographical feature, a\\nnavigable river which crosses the city from the south-west to the east. The\\nThames Valley is a floodplain surrounded by gently rolling hills including\\nParliament Hill, Addington Hills, and Primrose Hill. Historically London grew\\nup at the lowest bridging point on the Thames. The Thames was once a much\\nbroader, shallower river with extensive marshlands; at high tide, its shores\\nreached five times their present width.Since the Victorian era the Thames has\\nbeen extensively embanked, and many of its London tributaries now flow\\nunderground. The Thames is a tidal river, and London is vulnerable to flooding.\\nThe threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in\\nhigh water level by the slow \\'tilting\\' of Britain (up in the north and down in\\nthe south) caused by post-glacial rebound.In 1974, a decade of work began on\\nthe construction of the Thames Barrier across the Thames at Woolwich to deal\\nwith this threat. While the barrier is expected to function as designed until\\nroughly 2070, concepts for its future enlargement or redesign are already being\\ndiscussed.\\n\\nLondon has a temperate oceanic climate (KÃ¶ppen: Cfbâ€¯), similar\\nto all of southern England. Despite its reputation as being a rainy city,\\nLondon receives less precipitation in a year than Rome, Bordeaux, Lisbon,\\nNaples, Sydney and New York City. Temperature extremes for all sites in the\\nLondon area range from 38.1 Â°C (100.6 Â°F) at Kew during August 2003 down to\\nâˆ’16.1 Â°C (3.0 Â°F) at Northolt during January 1962.Summers are generally warm.\\nLondon\\'s average July high is 24 Â°C (74 Â°F). On average London will see 31 days\\nabove 25 Â°C (77.0 Â°F) each year, and 4.2 days above 30.0 Â°C (86.0 Â°F) every\\nyear. During the 2003 European heat wave there were 14 consecutive days above\\n30 Â°C (86.0 Â°F) and 2 consecutive days where temperatures reached 38 Â°C (100\\nÂ°F), leading to hundreds of heat related deaths.Winters are generally cool,\\ncloudy and damp with little temperature variation. Snowfall occurs occasionally\\nand can cause travel disruption when this happens. Snowfall is more common in\\nouter London. Spring and autumn are mixed seasons and can be pleasant. As a\\nlarge city, London has a considerable urban heat island effect, making the\\ncentre of London at times 5 Â°C (9 Â°F) warmer than the suburbs and outskirts.\\nThe effect of this can be seen below when comparing London Heathrow, 15 miles\\n(24 km) west of London, with the London Weather Centre, in the city\\ncentre.\\n\\nLondon\\'s vast urban area is often described using a set of\\ndistrict names, such as Bloomsbury, Mayfair, Wembley and Whitechapel. These are\\neither informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been\\nabsorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or\\nformer boroughs. Such names have remained in use through tradition, each\\nreferring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without\\nofficial boundaries. Since 1965 Greater London has been divided into 32 London\\nboroughs in addition to the ancient City of London. The City of London is the\\nmain financial district, and Canary Wharf has recently developed into a new\\nfinancial and commercial hub in the Docklands to the east. The West End is\\nLondon\\'s main entertainment and shopping district, attracting tourists. West\\nLondon includes expensive residential areas where properties can sell for tens\\nof millions of pounds. The average price for properties in Kensington and\\nChelsea is over Â£2 million with a similarly high outlay in most of central\\nLondon.The East End is the area closest to the original Port of London, known\\nfor its high immigrant population, as well as for being one of the poorest\\nareas in London. The surrounding East London area saw much of London\\'s early\\nindustrial development; now, brownfield sites throughout the area are being\\nredeveloped as part of the Thames Gateway including the London Riverside and\\nLower Lea Valley, which was developed into the Olympic Park for the 2012\\nOlympics and Paralympics.\\n\\nLondon\\'s buildings are too diverse to be\\ncharacterised by any particular architectural style, partly because of their\\nvarying ages. Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the National\\nGallery, are constructed from Portland stone. Some areas of the city,\\nparticularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white stucco\\nor whitewashed buildings. Few structures in central London pre-date the Great\\nFire of 1666, these being a few trace Roman remains, the Tower of London and a\\nfew scattered Tudor survivors in the City. Further out is, for example, the\\nTudor-period Hampton Court Palace, England\\'s oldest surviving Tudor palace,\\nbuilt by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey c.1515.17th-century churches by Wren,\\nneoclassical financial institutions such as the Royal Exchange and the Bank of\\nEngland, to the early 20th century Old Bailey and the 1960s Barbican Estate\\nform part of the varied architectural heritage.\\n\\nThe disused â€“ but soon\\nto be rejuvenated â€“ 1939 Battersea Power Station by the river in the south-west\\nis a local landmark, while some railway termini are excellent examples of\\nVictorian architecture, most notably St. Pancras and Paddington. The density of\\nLondon varies, with high employment density in the central area, high\\nresidential densities in inner London, and lower densities in Outer London. The\\nMonument in the City of London provides views of the surrounding area while\\ncommemorating the Great Fire of London, which originated nearby. Marble Arch\\nand Wellington Arch, at the north and south ends of Park Lane, respectively,\\nhave royal connections, as do the Albert Memorial and Royal Albert Hall in\\nKensington. Nelson\\'s Column is a nationally recognised monument in Trafalgar\\nSquare, one of the focal points of central London. Older buildings are mainly\\nbrick built, most commonly the yellow London stock brick or a warm orange-red\\nvariety, often decorated with carvings and white plaster mouldings.In the dense\\nareas, most of the concentration is via medium- and high-rise buildings.\\nLondon\\'s skyscrapers, such as 30 St Mary Axe, Tower 42, the Broadgate Tower and\\nOne Canada Square, are mostly in the two financial districts, the City of\\nLondon and Canary Wharf. High-rise development is restricted at certain sites\\nif it would obstruct protected views of St Paul\\'s Cathedral and other historic\\nbuildings. Nevertheless, there are a number of very tall skyscrapers in central\\nLondon (see Tall buildings in London), including the 95-storey Shard London\\nBridge, the tallest building in the European Union. Other notable modern\\nbuildings include City Hall in Southwark with its distinctive oval shape and\\nthe British Library in Somers Town/Kings Cross. What was formerly the\\nMillennium Dome, by the Thames to the east of Canary Wharf, is now an\\nentertainment venue called the O2 Arena.\\n\\nThe London Natural History Society suggest that London is \"one of the World\\'s\\nGreenest Cities\" with more than 40 percent green space or open water. They\\nindicate that 2000 species of flowering plant have been found growing there and\\nthat the tidal Thames supports 120 species of fish. They also state that over\\n60 species of bird nest in central London and that their members have recorded\\n47 species of butterfly, 1173 moths and more than 270 kinds of spider around\\nLondon. London\\'s wetland areas support nationally important populations of many\\nwater birds. London has 38 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), two\\nNational Nature Reserves and 76 Local Nature Reserves.Amphibians are common in\\nthe capital, including smooth newts living by the Tate Modern, and common\\nfrogs, common toads, palmate newts and great crested newts. On the other hand,\\nnative reptiles such as slowworms, common lizards, grass snakes and adders, are\\nmostly only seen in Outer London.\\n\\nAmong other inhabitants of London are\\n10,000 red foxes, so that there are now 16 foxes for every square mile (2.6\\nsquare kilometres) of London. These urban foxes are noticeably bolder than\\ntheir country cousins, sharing the pavement with pedestrians and raising cubs\\nin people\\'s backyards. Foxes have even sneaked into the Houses of Parliament,\\nwhere one was found asleep on a filing cabinet. Another broke into the grounds\\nof Buckingham Palace, reportedly killing some of Queen Elizabeth II\\'s prized\\npink flamingos. Generally, however, foxes and city folk appear to get along. A\\nsurvey in 2001 by the London-based Mammal Society found that 80 percent of\\n3,779 respondents who volunteered to keep a diary of garden mammal visits liked\\nhaving them around. This sample cannot be taken to represent Londoners as a\\nwhole.Other mammals found in Greater London are hedgehogs, rats, mice, rabbit,\\nshrew, vole, and squirrels, In wilder areas of Outer London, such as Epping\\nForest, a wide variety of mammals are found including hare, badger, field, bank\\nand water vole, wood mouse, yellow-necked mouse, mole, shrew, and weasel, in\\naddition to fox, squirrel and hedgehog. A dead otter was found at The Highway,\\nin Wapping, about a mile from the Tower Bridge, which would suggest that they\\nhave begun to move back after being absent a hundred years from the city. Ten\\nof England\\'s eighteen species of bats have been recorded in Epping Forest:\\nsoprano, nathusius and common pipistrelles, noctule, serotine, barbastelle,\\ndaubenton\\'s, brown Long-eared, natterer\\'s and leisler\\'s.Among the strange\\nsights seen in London have been a whale in the Thames, while the BBC Two\\nprogramme \"Natural World: Unnatural History of London\" shows pigeons using the\\nLondon Underground to get around the city, a seal that takes fish from\\nfishmongers outside Billingsgate Fish Market, and foxes that will \"sit\" if\\ngiven sausages.Herds of red and fallow deer also roam freely within much of\\nRichmond and Bushy Park. A cull takes place each November and February to\\nensure numbers can be sustained. Epping Forest is also known for its fallow\\ndeer, which can frequently be seen in herds to the north of the Forest. A rare\\npopulation of melanistic, black fallow deer is also maintained at the Deer\\nSanctuary near Theydon Bois. Muntjac deer, which escaped from deer parks at the\\nturn of the twentieth century, are also found in the forest. While Londoners\\nare accustomed to wildlife such as birds and foxes sharing the city, more\\nrecently urban deer have started becoming a regular feature, and whole herds of\\nfallow deer come into residential areas at night to take advantage of London\\'s\\ngreen spaces.\\n\\nLondon maps showing the percentage distribution of selected\\nraces according to the 2011 Census The 2011 census recorded that 2,998,264\\npeople or 36.7% of London\\'s population are foreign-born making London the city\\nwith the second largest immigrant population, behind New York City, in terms of\\nabsolute numbers. About 69% of children born in London in 2015 had at least one\\nparent who was born abroad. The table to the right shows the most common\\ncountries of birth of London residents. Note that some of the German-born\\npopulation, in 18th position, are British citizens from birth born to parents\\nserving in the British Armed Forces in Germany.With increasing\\nindustrialisation, London\\'s population grew rapidly throughout the 19th and\\nearly 20th centuries, and it was for some time in the late 19th and early 20th\\ncenturies the most populous city in the world. Its population peaked at\\n8,615,245 in 1939 immediately before the outbreak of the Second World War, but\\nhad declined to 7,192,091 at the 2001 Census. However, the population then grew\\nby just over a million between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, to reach 8,173,941\\nin the latter enumeration.However, London\\'s continuous urban area extends\\nbeyond the borders of Greater London and was home to 9,787,426 people in 2011,\\nwhile its wider metropolitan area has a population of between 12 and 14 million\\ndepending on the definition used. According to Eurostat, London is the most\\npopulous city and metropolitan area of the European Union and the second most\\npopulous in Europe. During the period 1991â€“2001 a net 726,000 immigrants\\narrived in London.The region covers an area of 1,579 square kilometres (610 sq\\nmi). The population density is 5,177 inhabitants per square kilometre\\n(13,410/sq mi), more than ten times that of any other British region. In terms\\nof population, London is the 19th largest city and the 18th largest\\nmetropolitan region in the world. As of  2014[update], London has the largest\\nnumber of billionaires (British Pound Sterling) in the world, with 72 residing\\nin the city. London ranks as one of the most expensive cities in the world,\\nalongside Tokyo and Moscow.\\n\\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, based on the 2011 Census\\nestimates, 59.8 per cent of the 8,173,941 inhabitants of London were White,\\nwith 44.9 per cent White British, 2.2 per cent White Irish, 0.1 per cent\\ngypsy/Irish traveller and 12.1 per cent classified as Other White. 20.9 per\\ncent of Londoners are of Asian and mixed-Asian descent. 19.7 per cent are of\\nfull Asian descent, with those of mixed-Asian heritage comprising 1.2 of the\\npopulation. Indians account for 6.6 per cent of the population, followed by\\nPakistanis and Bangladeshis at 2.7 per cent each. Chinese peoples account for\\n1.5 per cent of the population, with Arabs comprising 1.3 per cent. A further\\n4.9 per cent are classified as \"Other Asian\". 15.6 per cent of London\\'s\\npopulation are of Black and mixed-Black descent. 13.3 per cent are of full\\nBlack descent, with those of mixed-Black heritage comprising 2.3 per cent.\\nBlack Africans account for 7.0 per cent of London\\'s population, with 4.2 per\\ncent as Black Caribbean and 2.1 per cent as \"Other Black\". 5.0 per cent are of\\nmixed race. Across London, Black and Asian children outnumber White British\\nchildren by about six to four in state schools. Altogether at the 2011 census,\\nof London\\'s 1,624,768 population aged 0 to 15, 46.4 per cent were White, 19.8\\nper cent were Asian, 19 per cent were Black, 10.8 per cent were Mixed and 4 per\\ncent represented another ethnic group. In January 2005, a survey of London\\'s\\nethnic and religious diversity claimed that there were more than 300 languages\\nspoken in London and more than 50 non-indigenous communities with a population\\nof more than 10,000. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that,\\nin 2010[update], London\\'s foreign-born population was 2,650,000 (33 per cent),\\nup from 1,630,000 in 1997. The 2011 census showed that 36.7 per cent of Greater\\nLondon\\'s population were born outside the UK. A portion of the German-born\\npopulation are likely to be British nationals born to parents serving in the\\nBritish Armed Forces in Germany. Estimates produced by the Office for National\\nStatistics indicate that the five largest foreign-born groups living in London\\nin the period July 2009 to June 2010 were those born in India, Poland, the\\nRepublic of Ireland, Bangladesh and Nigeria.\\n\\nAccording to the 2011\\nCensus, the largest religious groupings are Christians (48.4 per cent),\\nfollowed by those of no religion (20.7 per cent), Muslims (12.4 per cent), no\\nresponse (8.5 per cent), Hindus (5.0 per cent), Jews (1.8 per cent), Sikhs (1.5\\nper cent), Buddhists (1.0 per cent) and other (0.6 per cent). London has\\ntraditionally been Christian, and has a large number of churches, particularly\\nin the City of London. The well-known St Paul\\'s Cathedral in the City and\\nSouthwark Cathedral south of the river are Anglican administrative centres,\\nwhile the Archbishop of Canterbury, principal bishop of the Church of England\\nand worldwide Anglican Communion, has his main residence at Lambeth Palace in\\nthe London Borough of Lambeth.\\n\\nImportant national and royal ceremonies are\\nshared between St Paul\\'s and Westminster Abbey. The Abbey is not to be confused\\nwith nearby Westminster Cathedral, which is the largest Roman Catholic\\ncathedral in England and Wales. Despite the prevalence of Anglican churches,\\nobservance is very low within the Anglican denomination. Church attendance\\ncontinues on a long, slow, steady decline, according to Church of England\\nstatistics.London is also home to sizeable Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, and Jewish\\ncommunities. Notable mosques include the East London Mosque in Tower Hamlets,\\nLondon Central Mosque on the edge of Regent\\'s Park and the Baitul Futuh Mosque\\nof the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. Following the oil boom, increasing numbers\\nof wealthy Hindus and Middle-Eastern Muslims have based themselves around\\nMayfair and Knightsbridge in West London. There are large Muslim communities in\\nthe eastern boroughs of Tower Hamlets and Newham. Large Hindu communities are\\nin the north-western boroughs of Harrow and Brent, the latter of which is home\\nto Europe\\'s largest Hindu temple, Neasden Temple. London is also home to 42\\nHindu temples. There are Sikh communities in East and West London, particularly\\nin Southall, home to one of the largest Sikh populations and the largest Sikh\\ntemple outside India.The majority of British Jews live in London, with\\nsignificant Jewish communities in Stamford Hill, Stanmore, Golders Green,\\nFinchley, Hampstead, Hendon and Edgware in North London. Bevis Marks Synagogue\\nin the City of London is affiliated to London\\'s historic Sephardic Jewish\\ncommunity. It is the only synagogue in Europe which has held regular services\\ncontinuously for over 300 years. Stanmore and Canons Park Synagogue has the\\nlargest membership of any single Orthodox synagogue in the whole of Europe,\\novertaking Ilford synagogue (also in London) in 1998. The community set up the\\nLondon Jewish Forum in 2006 in response to the growing significance of devolved\\nLondon Government.  There are many accents traditionally associated with\\nLondon. The most well known of the London accents long ago acquired the Cockney\\nlabel from London\\'s East End, which is heard both in London itself, and across\\nthe wider South East England region more generally. The accent of a\\n21st-century Londoner varies widely; what is becoming more and more common\\namongst the under-30s however is some fusion of Cockney with a whole array of\\nethnic accents, in particular Caribbean, which form an accent labelled\\nMulticultural London English (MLE). The other widely heard and spoken accent is\\nRP (Received Pronunciation) in various forms, which can often be heard in the\\nmedia and many of other traditional professions and beyond, although this\\naccent is not limited to London and South East England, and can also be heard\\nselectively throughout the whole UK amongst certain social groupings. Since the\\nturn of the century the Cockney dialect is less common in the East End and has\\n\\'migrated\\' east to Havering and the county of Essex.\\n\\nLondon produced in\\n2015 about Â£378 billion (â‚¬530 billion or $600 billion), over 22% of UK GDP,\\nwhile the economy of the London metropolitan areaâ€”the largest in\\nEuropeâ€”generates about 30 per cent of the UK\\'s GDP (or an estimated $669\\nbillion in 2005). London has five major business districts: the City,\\nWestminster, Canary Wharf, Camden & Islington and Lambeth & Southwark. One way\\nto get an idea of their relative importance is to look at relative amounts of\\noffice space: Greater London had 27 million m2 of office space in 2001, and the\\nCity contains the most space, with 8 million m2 of office space. London has\\nsome of the highest real estate prices in the world. London is the world\\'s most\\nexpensive office market for the last three years according to world property\\njournal (2015) report. As of  2015[update] the residential property in London\\nis worth $2.2 trillion â€“ same value as that of Brazil annual GDP. The city has\\nthe highest property prices of any European city according to the Office for\\nNational Statistics and the European Office of Statistics. On average the price\\nper square metre in central London is â‚¬24,252 (April 2014). This is higher than\\nthe property prices in other G8 European capital cities; Berlin â‚¬3,306, Rome\\nâ‚¬6,188 and Paris â‚¬11,229.\\n\\nLondon finance industry is based in the City of\\nLondon and Canary Wharf, the two major Central Business Districts in London.\\nLondon is one of the pre-eminent financial centres of the world as the most\\nimportant location for international finance. London took over as a major\\nfinancial centre shortly after 1795 when the Dutch Republic collapsed before\\nthe Napoleonic armies. For many bankers established in Amsterdam (e.g. Hope,\\nBaring), this was only time to move to London. The London financial elite was\\nstrengthened by a strong Jewish community from all over Europe capable of\\nmastering the most sophisticated financial tools of the time. This unique\\nconcentration of talents accelerated the transition from the Commercial\\nRevolution to the Industrial Revolution. By the end of the 19th century,\\nBritain was the wealthiest of all nations, and London a leading financial\\ncentre. Still, as of 2016 London tops the world rankings on the Global\\nFinancial Centres Index (GFCI), and it ranked second in A.T. Kearney\\'s 2018\\nGlobal Cities Index.London\\'s largest industry is finance, and its financial\\nexports make it a large contributor to the UK\\'s balance of payments. Around\\n325,000 people were employed in financial services in London until mid-2007.\\nLondon has over 480 overseas banks, more than any other city in the world. It\\nis also the world\\'s biggest currency trading centre, accounting for some 37\\npercent of the $5.1 trillion average daily volume, according to the BIS. Over\\n85 percent (3.2 million) of the employed population of greater London works in\\nthe services industries. Because of its prominent global role, London\\'s economy\\nhad been affected by the financial crisis of 2007â€“2008. However, by 2010 the\\nCity has recovered; put in place new regulatory powers, proceeded to regain\\nlost ground and re-established London\\'s economic dominance. Along with\\nprofessional services headquarters, the City of London is home to the Bank of\\nEngland, London Stock Exchange, and Lloyd\\'s of London insurance market. Over\\nhalf of the UK\\'s top 100 listed companies (the FTSE 100) and over 100 of\\nEurope\\'s 500 largest companies have their headquarters in central London. Over\\n70 per cent of the FTSE 100 are within London\\'s metropolitan area, and 75 per\\ncent of Fortune 500 companies have offices in London.  Media companies are\\nconcentrated in London and the media distribution industry is London\\'s second\\nmost competitive sector. The BBC is a significant employer, while other\\nbroadcasters also have headquarters around the City. Many national newspapers\\nare edited in London. London is a major retail centre and in 2010 had the\\nhighest non-food retail sales of any city in the world, with a total spend of\\naround Â£64.2 billion. The Port of London is the second-largest in the United\\nKingdom, handling 45 million tonnes of cargo each year.A growing number of\\ntechnology companies are based in London notably in East London Tech City, also\\nknown as Silicon Roundabout. In April 2014, the city was among the first to\\nreceive a geoTLD. In February 2014 London was ranked as the European City of\\nthe Future  in the 2014/15 list by FDi Magazine.The gas and electricity\\ndistribution networks that manage and operate the towers, cables and pressure\\nsystems that deliver energy to consumers across the city are managed by\\nNational Grid plc, SGN and UK Power Networks.\\n\\nLondon is one of the leading\\ntourist destinations in the world and in 2015 was ranked as the most visited\\ncity in the world with over 65 million visits. It is also the top city in the\\nworld by visitor cross-border spending, estimated at US$20.23 billion in 2015.\\nTourism is one of London\\'s prime industries, employing the equivalent of\\n350,000 full-time workers in 2003, and the city accounts for 54% of all inbound\\nvisitor spending in the UK. As of  2016[update] London is the world top city\\ndestination as ranked by TripAdvisor users.In 2015 the top most-visited\\nattractions in the UK were all in London. The top 10 most visited attractions\\nwere: (with visits per venue)\\n\\nThe British Museum: 6,820,686 The National\\nGallery: 5,908,254 The Natural History Museum (South Kensington): 5,284,023 The\\nSouthbank Centre: 5,102,883 Tate Modern: 4,712,581 The Victoria and Albert\\nMuseum (South Kensington): 3,432,325 The Science Museum: 3,356,212 Somerset\\nHouse: 3,235,104 The Tower of London: 2,785,249 The National Portrait Gallery:\\n2,145,486The number of hotel rooms in London in 2015 stood at 138,769, and is\\nexpected to grow over the years.\\n\\nTransport is one of the four main areas\\nof policy administered by the Mayor of London, however the mayor\\'s financial\\ncontrol does not extend to the longer distance rail network that enters London.\\nIn 2007 he assumed responsibility for some local lines, which now form the\\nLondon Overground network, adding to the existing responsibility for the London\\nUnderground, trams and buses. The public transport network is administered by\\nTransport for London (TFL). The lines that formed the London Underground, as\\nwell as trams and buses, became part of an integrated transport system in 1933\\nwhen the London Passenger Transport Board or London Transport was created.\\nTransport for London is now the statutory corporation responsible for most\\naspects of the transport system in Greater London, and is run by a board and a\\ncommissioner appointed by the Mayor of London.\\n\\nLondon is a major\\ninternational air transport hub with the busiest city airspace in the world.\\nEight airports use the word London in their name, but most traffic passes\\nthrough six of these. Additionally, various other airports also serve London,\\ncatering primarily to general aviation flights.  London Heathrow Airport, in\\nHillingdon, West London, was for many years the busiest airport in the world\\nfor international traffic, and is the major hub of the nation\\'s flag carrier,\\nBritish Airways.  In March 2008 its fifth terminal was opened. In 2014, Dubai\\ngained from Heathrow the leading position in terms of international passenger\\ntraffic. London Gatwick Airport, south of London in West Sussex, handles\\nflights to more destinations than any other UK airport and is the main base of\\neasyJet, the UK\\'s largest airline by number of passengers. London Stansted\\nAirport, north-east of London in Essex, has flights that serve the greatest\\nnumber of European destinations of any UK airport and is the main base of\\nRyanair, the world\\'s largest international airline by number of international\\npassengers. London Luton Airport, to the north of London in Bedfordshire, is\\nused by several budget airlines for short-haul flights. London City Airport,\\nthe most central airport and the one with the shortest runway, in Newham, East\\nLondon, is focused on business travellers, with a mixture of full-service\\nshort-haul scheduled flights and considerable business jet traffic. London\\nSouthend Airport, east of London in Essex, is a smaller, regional airport that\\ncaters for short-haul flights on a limited, though growing, number of airlines.\\nIn 2017, international passengers made up over 95% of the total at Southend,\\nthe highest proportion of any London airport.\\n\\nThe London Underground,\\ncommonly referred to as the Tube, is the oldest and third longest metro system\\nin the world. The system serves 270 stations and was formed from several\\nprivate companies, including the world\\'s first underground electric line, the\\nCity and South London Railway. It dates from 1863.Over four million journeys\\nare made every day on the Underground network, over 1 billion each year. An\\ninvestment programme is attempting to reduce congestion and improve\\nreliability, including Â£6.5 billion (â‚¬7.7 billion) spent before the 2012 Summer\\nOlympics. The Docklands Light Railway (DLR), which opened in 1987, is a second,\\nmore local metro system using smaller and lighter tram-type vehicles that serve\\nthe Docklands, Greenwich and Lewisham.\\n\\nThere are more than 360 railway\\nstations in the London Travelcard Zones on an extensive above-ground suburban\\nrailway network. South London, particularly, has a high concentration of\\nrailways as it has fewer Underground lines. Most rail lines terminate around\\nthe centre of London, running into eighteen terminal stations, with the\\nexception of the Thameslink trains connecting Bedford in the north and Brighton\\nin the south via Luton and Gatwick airports. London has Britain\\'s busiest\\nstation by number of passengers â€“ Waterloo, with over 184 million people using\\nthe interchange station complex (which includes Waterloo East station) each\\nyear. Clapham Junction is the busiest station in Europe by the number of trains\\npassing. With the need for more rail capacity in London, Crossrail is due to\\nopen in 2018. It will be a new railway line running east to west through London\\nand into the Home Counties with a branch to Heathrow Airport. It is Europe\\'s\\nbiggest construction project, with a Â£15 billion projected cost.\\n\\nLondon is the centre of the National Rail network, with 70 percent of rail journeys\\nstarting or ending in London. Like suburban rail services, regional and\\ninter-city trains depart from several termini around the city centre, linking\\nLondon with the rest of Britain including Birmingham, Brighton, Reading,\\nBristol, Cardiff, Derby, Exeter, Sheffield, Southampton, Leeds, Liverpool,\\nManchester, Cambridge, Newcastle upon Tyne, Edinburgh and Glasgow. Some\\ninternational railway services to Continental Europe were operated during the\\n20th century as boat trains, such as the Admiraal de Ruijter to Amsterdam and\\nthe Night Ferry to Paris and Brussels. The opening of the Channel Tunnel in\\n1994 connected London directly to the continental rail network, allowing\\nEurostar services to begin. Since 2007, high-speed trains link St. Pancras\\nInternational with Lille, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and other European tourist\\ndestinations via the High Speed 1 rail link and the Channel Tunnel. The first\\nhigh-speed domestic trains started in June 2009 linking Kent to London. There\\nare plans for a second high speed line linking London to the Midlands, North\\nWest England, and Yorkshire.\\n\\nAlthough rail freight levels are far down\\ncompared to their height, significant quantities of cargo are also carried into\\nand out of London by rail; chiefly building materials and landfill waste. As a\\nmajor hub of the British railway network, London\\'s tracks also carry large\\namounts of freight for the other regions, such as container freight from the\\nChannel Tunnel and English Channel ports, and nuclear waste for reprocessing at\\nSellafield.\\n\\nLondon\\'s bus network is one of the largest in the world,\\nrunning 24 hours a day, with about 8,500 buses, more than 700 bus routes and\\naround 19,500 bus stops. In 2013, the network had more than 2 billion commuter\\ntrips per annum, more than the Underground. Around Â£850 million is taken in\\nrevenue each year. London has the largest wheelchair accessible network in the\\nworld and, from the 3rd quarter of 2007, became more accessible to hearing and\\nvisually impaired passengers as audio-visual announcements were introduced. The\\ndistinctive red double-decker buses are an internationally recognised trademark\\nof London transport along with black cabs and the Tube.London has a modern tram\\nnetwork, known as Tramlink, centred on Croydon in South London. The network has\\n39 stops and four routes, and carried 28 million people in 2013. Since June\\n2008 Transport for London has completely owned Tramlink, and it plans to spend\\nÂ£54m by 2015 on maintenance, renewals, upgrades and capacity enhancements.\\nLondon\\'s first and only cable car, known as the Emirates Air Line, opened in\\nJune 2012. Crossing the River Thames, linking Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal\\nDocks in the east of the city, the cable car is integrated with London\\'s Oyster\\nCard ticketing system, although special fares are charged. Costing Â£60 million\\nto build, it carries over 3,500 passengers every day, although this is very\\nmuch lower than its capacity. Similar to the Santander Cycles bike hire scheme,\\nthe cable car is sponsored in a 10-year deal by the airline Emirates.\\nIn the whole Greater London Area, around 650,000 people use a bike everyday.\\nBut out of a total population of around 8.8 million , this means that just\\naround 7% of Greater London\\'s population use a bike on an average day. This is\\na small proportion, when compared to many other cities in the world  A reason\\nmay well be the poor investments for cycling in the UK. In England, cycling\\ninvestment equates to around Â£1.40 per person and year, which can be compared\\nto Â£22 in the Netherlands.Cycling is nevertheless becoming increasingly popular\\nway to get around London. The launch of a cycle hire scheme in July 2010 has\\nbeen successful and generally well received. The London Cycling Campaign\\nlobbies for better provision. There are many cycle routes in London, including\\nseveral Cycle Superhighways.\\n\\nFrom being the largest port in the world, the\\nPort of London is now only the second-largest in the United Kingdom, handling\\n45 million tonnes of cargo each year. Most of this actually passes through the\\nPort of Tilbury, outside the boundary of Greater London. London has frequent\\nriver boat services on the Thames known as Thames Clippers. These run up to\\nevery 20 minutes between Embankment Pier and North Greenwich Pier. The Woolwich\\nFerry, with 2.5 million passengers every year, is a frequent service linking\\nthe North and South Circular Roads. Other operators run both commuter and\\ntourist boat services in London.\\n\\nAlthough the majority of journeys\\ninvolving central London are made by public transport, car travel is common in\\nthe suburbs. The inner ring road (around the city centre), the North and South\\nCircular roads (in the suburbs), and the outer orbital motorway (the M25,\\noutside the built-up area) encircle the city and are intersected by a number of\\nbusy radial routesâ€”but very few motorways penetrate into inner London. A plan\\nfor a comprehensive network of motorways throughout the city (the Ringways\\nPlan) was prepared in the 1960s but was mostly cancelled in the early 1970s.\\nThe M25 is the second-longest ring-road motorway in Europe at 117 mi (188 km)\\nlong. The A1 and M1 connect London to Leeds, and Newcastle and Edinburgh.\\nLondon is notorious for its traffic congestion, with the average speed of a car\\nin the rush hour being 10.6 mph (17.1 km/h).In 2003, a congestion charge was\\nintroduced to reduce traffic volumes in the city centre. With a few exceptions,\\nmotorists are required to pay Â£10 per day to drive within a defined zone\\nencompassing much of central London. Motorists who are residents of the defined\\nzone can buy a greatly reduced season pass. London government initially\\nexpected the Congestion Charge Zone to increase daily peak period Underground\\nand bus users by 20,000 people, reduce road traffic by 10 to 15 per cent,\\nincrease traffic speeds by 10 to 15 per cent, and reduce queues by 20 to 30 per\\ncent.
